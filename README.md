china trivia multimodal support with Alexa APL

## Inspiration
To participate the Alexa Multimodal Challenge, we (at Youth Innovation Club) initial a group design to find the right idea of the skill to be built.
## What it does
This china trivia is a very basic trivia for china related knowledge, but it can support all the Alexa based device with mutlimodal.
## How I built it
We create a china trivia basic skill first, then enhance it with the APL to support the multimodal.
## Challenges I ran into
The certification part is really challenge.
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
We start to brainstorm the idea and build this skill within three weeks, and finish it from beginning to end with such a short timeframe, really proud of our achievement.
## What I learned
We learn everything from Amazon Alexa, AWS, to multimodal, and APL, pack of knowledge.
## What's next for China Trivia with Alexa APL
We will continue improve it, and add more functionality to this skill.
